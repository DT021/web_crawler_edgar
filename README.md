***********************************************************

This crawler parses fund holdings from Edgar, reported in
quarterly-filed 13F documents.  

***To retrieve fund holdings you must enter a valid CIK***  

13F documents are filed by Private Trusts, Banks, Insurance
Companies, Investment Advisors, Institutional Managers and
Hedge Funds, but not Mutual Funds.

To procure the CIK of a mutual fund you will need to 
ascertain the name of the institutional manager of that 
mutual fund. For example, Sequoia Fund is a mutual fund, 
but they do not file a 13F. However, Sequoia's institutional 
manager, "Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc", does file a 13F. 
Therefore using Ruane, Cunniff's CIK you can accurately 
parse the holdings for the Sequoia Fund.

If you need help searching for valid CIKs this website helps:
